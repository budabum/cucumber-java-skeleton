##1. Begining

1.1. Clone project
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/budabum/cucumber-java-skeleton 
  cd cucumber-java-skeleton
  mvn -e test
  ```
  
  Expect 1 scenario to be run, 1 step to pass and 2 to be pending.
  
1.2. Run idea
  
  1.2.1. Import project from maven

  1.2.2. Optional. Do it if Idea cucumber plugin has not been installed
  ```
  Settings -> Plugins -> Browse plugin repository and type cucumber in search.
  Install Cucumber for Java and agree to install dependant plugin.
  ```
  1.2.3. Run belly.feature file (should fail - has pending steps)

  1.2.4. Run RunCukesTest file (1 step passed and 2 ignored)
  
## 2. Evolution 1. Make test works

2.1. Copy autogenerated steps from cnsole into Stepdefs.java

2.2. Run

2.3. Add code to make test passed

2.4. Change something in test scenario to make it failed (this is important!)

## 3. Evolution 2. API testing

3.1. Get first version from git
  ```
  git checkout tag/step1
  ```
  
open file api_test.feature
Run it and then RunCukeTests
Insert features and tags to run only needed scenarios
Replace
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"})
with
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"}, features = {"src/test/resources/skeleton/api_test.feature"})
Then add tag ‘@my’ to one of scenarios and into runner
@CucumberOptions(plugin = {"pretty"}, features = {"src/test/resources/skeleton/api_test.feature"}, tags=”@my”)
TASK: crate a couple more tests for one of these methods (see StringSteps)
Use http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html as requirements
Running test server
git checkout tag/step2
open new terminal or tab in terminal or use screen command line utility
run test server
ruby test-server.rb
Should start. Go to http://localhost:9944/ to check.
To install it in your environment do the following (already done in class)
Install ruby 1.9.3+
on ubuntu: sudo apt-get install ruby
for other OS use ruby documentation https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ or better use http://rvm.io/ 
Install ‘sinatra’ web server
on linux: sudo gem install sinatra
on other OS, e.g. Windows:  gem install sinatra
Shutdown test server (ctrl+c in its console)
Evolution 3. Rest testing.
git checkout tag/step3
run test server
look at file rest_test.feature - you can run it but it’ll not work (why???)
Set tags and run RunCukeTests - will work
Let’s look at steps: RestSteps
TASK: Create one more test for route /plus
http://localhost:9944/math/plus?a=2&b=3 -url spec for instance
TASK*: Create one more test for route /divide
http://localhost:9944/math/divide?a=9&b=3 -url spec for instance
Evolution 4. Rest testing continued.
git checkout tag/step4
restart test server
update maven dependencies in idea (if autoupdate is off)
let’s install postman (plugin for chrome/chromium)
run in postman
GET http://localhost:9944/users 
POST http://localhost:9944/users/add 
Content-Type: application/json
{"email":"user11@email.com", "firstName":"autotest", "lastName":"user"}
GET http://localhost:9944/users?email=user12@email.com 
DELETE http://localhost:9944/users 
look at file rest_test.feature - new scenario - get users with data table
look at file RestSteps - it has changed.
TASK: create a couple more tests for /users routes
Evolution 5. Web testing
git checkout tag/step5
restart test server
update maven dependencies in dea (if autoupdate is off)
look at file selenium_test.feature - run it (expected to fail)
look at SeleniumSteps.
Uncomment lines 74,75 and comment 73.
run test again - should pass
TASK: create one more test for any page
